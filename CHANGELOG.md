# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [v0.8.0-alpha] — In Progress

> **2026-04-29 audit:** see [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) for the full bucketed status (shipped / in-flight / blocked / deferred) and the proposed v0.8.0 definition-of-done. Active blocker: dropdown detail-view wiring deleted in commit `2d844c9` — `ItemExpandPanel.tsx` is currently orphaned and must be re-mounted before v0.8.0 can ship. Sea Creatures tab is shipped as data only (PR #35); UI wiring is in flight on PR #44.

### Added
- **React Router v6** — URL-based navigation replaces single-page state; each town and museum tab now has a shareable URL
  - Route structure: `/` → redirects to active town; `/town/:townId` → home tab; `/town/:townId/:tab` → specific tab
  - `BrowserRouter` wraps the app in `main.tsx`; `vercel.json` adds a catch-all SPA rewrite for preview/branch deploys
  - Tab switching and town switching both update the URL via `useNavigate`; browser back/forward navigate between tabs and towns
  - Deep links work — visiting `/town/<id>/fish` loads that town's fish tab directly
  - `CreateTownModal` navigates to the new town's URL after creation



### Added
- **New Horizons data** — `public/data/acnh/` with 81 fish, 80 bugs, 86 fossil pieces, 43 art pieces, and 40 sea creatures; fish/bugs/sea creatures include both Northern and Southern Hemisphere month availability (`months_nh` / `months_sh`); art pieces include `hasFake` flag for counterfeit detection
- Game selector in Create Town modal — players can now choose Animal Crossing (GCN), Wild World, City Folk, New Leaf, or New Horizons when creating a new town; `CreateTownModal` now derives game list from the `GAMES` registry rather than a hardcoded array
- `categoryMeta.ts` — added ACNL and ACNH data directory paths and art support for both games
- **Item detail view (inline expand)** — clicking a fish, bug, or fossil row now expands it in-place to show full detail: month availability grid, sell value, habitat (fish), and notes. Art still opens the existing bottom-sheet modal. Donate/undonate button is included in the expand panel so the user never needs to leave the list.
  - `src/components/ItemExpandPanel.tsx` — new inline expand panel component
  - `CollectibleRow` updated with optional chevron indicator and rounded-top-only corners when expanded

## [v0.7.0-alpha] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Game selection UI** — `CreateTownModal` now shows a visual card selector for available games (ACGCN, ACWW); only games with data files under `public/data/` are shown; defaults to the most recent town's game or ACGCN; selected `gameId` is saved to the town on creation
- **Game badges in town switcher** — each town in the dropdown now shows a small coloured badge with the game's short name (e.g. "Wild World", "Animal Crossing")
- **Version bump** — `package.json` updated to `0.7.0-alpha`
- **Build version badge** — version string (from `package.json` via `VITE_APP_VERSION`) displayed in small muted text at the bottom of the museum canvas; `vite.config.ts` injects version at build time
- **Edit/rename town** — inline edit flow for town names; pencil icon in town switcher opens modal
- **Wild World data** — `public/data/acww/` with 56 fish, 56 bugs, and 52 fossils; item IDs shared with GCN where species overlap
- **City Folk data** — `public/data/accf/` with 40 fish, 40 bugs, and 52 fossils; item IDs shared with GCN/WW where species overlap
- **ACCanvas decomposition (Steps 4–8):** `ACCanvas.tsx` reduced from ~2175 lines to 298 lines (thin orchestration shell). Extracted into focused modules:
  - `src/lib/categoryMeta.ts` — `CATEGORY_META` constant (label/Icon/file per category)
  - `src/lib/viewTypes.ts` — `ViewId` and `AllData` types
  - `src/components/shared/` — `EmptyState`, `HabitatChip`, `DonateToggle`, `MonthGrid`, `SearchBar`, `CategoryProgress`
  - `src/components/modals/` — `CreateTownModal`, `EditTownModal`, `DetailModal`
  - `src/components/search/` — `GlobalSearchBar`, `GlobalSearchResults`, `SearchHistoryPopover`
  - `src/components/views/` — `AnalyticsView`, `ActivityFeed`, `SectionCard`
  - `src/components/CollectibleRow.tsx`, `TownSwitcher.tsx`, `MuseumHeader.tsx`, `TabBar.tsx`
  - `src/hooks/useMuseumData.ts`, `useSearch.ts`, `useCategoryStats.ts`
- **Multi-game foundation (Steps 1–3):**
  - `GameId` union type (`ACGCN | ACWW | ACCF | ACNL | ACNH`) + `Game` interface and `GAMES` registry
  - 3-level donation schema: `donated[townId][gameId][itemId]`; Zustand persist upgraded to v2 with lossless migration
  - `src/lib/bootstrapMigration.ts` — one-time localStorage key rename before React mounts
  - `src/lib/storeMigrations.ts` — Zustand v1→v2 migration; backfills `gameId = 'ACGCN'` for existing towns
  - `src/lib/constants.ts` — `MONTH_NAMES`, `CATEGORY_LABELS`, `CATEGORY_ORDER`, `SEASONS`
  - `src/lib/colors.ts` — design token hex constants
  - `src/hooks/useHydration.ts` — hydration guard via `onFinishHydration`; eliminates empty-state flash
- **ErrorBoundary** (`src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`) — top-level React error boundary; unhandled crashes render `ErrorState`
- **Pre-commit hooks** — Husky + lint-staged; ESLint + Prettier run on staged `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` before every commit
- `docs/v0.7-audit.md` — comprehensive codebase audit covering component modularity, type safety, state management, latent bugs, and multi-game architectural readiness
- `docs/v0.7-architecture-proposal.md` — multi-game foundation design: store schema, decomposition plan for ACCanvas

- **Game-aware museum data loading** — `useMuseumData` now accepts a `gameId` and fetches from the correct `/data/<game>/` directory; re-fetches automatically when the active town's game changes. Art tab is hidden for games without art data (ACWW, ACCF). If the user was on the art tab and switches to a non-GCN town, the tab resets to Home.

### Changed
- `AppErrorKind` unified across `ErrorBanner` and `ErrorState` — single discriminated union in `types.ts`
- `HomeTab` — replaced `as any` cast with `AnyItem` union type; fixed stale `React.ElementType` import
- ACCanvas per-category filter and global search now call `filterByQuery()` / `globalFilter()` from utils; inline reimplementations removed
- `Town` interface gains `gameId` field (defaults to `'ACGCN'` for new towns; backfilled for existing)

### Infrastructure
- **ESLint config** — added `varsIgnorePattern: '^_'` so intentionally unused `_`-prefixed variables don't error; added Vitest/Jest globals for test files
- **Prettier** — auto-format applied across `src/` post-merge
- **`.gitignore`** — added `.DS_Store`, `.claude/worktrees/`, `.claire/`

### Fixed
- **Seasonal analytics bug (#1)** — "Seasonal Breakdown" section in Stats tab now counts
  donated fish/bugs available *in-game per season* (based on `months[]` data), not the
  timestamps of when items were donated. Previously everything showed as Spring because
  all donations were recorded in April.
- **Edit Town modal visual polish** — modal now renders via React portal to `document.body`,
  escaping the `overflow-hidden` header stacking context that caused visual clipping.
- **Missing `@vercel/analytics` dependency** — package was referenced in `App.tsx` but not
  installed; added to dependencies so the build no longer fails.
- **Type safety** — `isFish()`, `isFossil()`, `isArtPiece()` type guards in `utils.ts`; `itemNotes()` no longer does an unsafe `as FishType` cast
