All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [v0.7.0] — In Progress

### Added
- **Edit/rename town** — inline edit flow for town names; pencil icon in town switcher opens modal
- **Wild World data** — `public/data/acww/` with 56 fish, 56 bugs, and 52 fossils; item IDs shared with GCN where species overlap
- **Multi-game foundation (Steps 1–3):**
  - `GameId` union type (`ACGCN | ACWW | ACCF | ACNL | ACNH`) + `Game` interface and `GAMES` registry
  - 3-level donation schema: `donated[townId][gameId][itemId]`; Zustand persist upgraded to v2 with lossless migration
  - `src/lib/bootstrapMigration.ts` — one-time localStorage key rename before React mounts
  - `src/lib/storeMigrations.ts` — Zustand v1→v2 migration; backfills `gameId = 'ACGCN'` for existing towns
  - `src/lib/constants.ts` — `MONTH_NAMES`, `CATEGORY_LABELS`, `CATEGORY_ORDER`, `SEASONS`
  - `src/lib/colors.ts` — design token hex constants
  - `src/hooks/useHydration.ts` — hydration guard via `onFinishHydration`; eliminates empty-state flash
- **ErrorBoundary** (`src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`) — top-level React error boundary; unhandled crashes render `ErrorState`
- **Pre-commit hooks** — Husky + lint-staged; ESLint + Prettier run on staged `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` before every commit
- `docs/v0.7-audit.md` — comprehensive codebase audit covering component modularity, type safety, state management, latent bugs, and multi-game architectural readiness
- `docs/v0.7-architecture-proposal.md` — multi-game foundation design: store schema, decomposition plan for ACCanvas

### Changed
- `AppErrorKind` unified across `ErrorBanner` and `ErrorState` — single discriminated union in `types.ts`
- `HomeTab` — replaced `as any` cast with `AnyItem` union type; fixed stale `React.ElementType` import
- ACCanvas per-category filter and global search now call `filterByQuery()` / `globalFilter()` from utils; inline reimplementations removed
- `Town` interface gains `gameId` field (defaults to `'ACGCN'` for new towns; backfilled for existing)

### Fixed
- **Seasonal analytics bug (#1)** — "Seasonal Breakdown" section in Stats tab now counts
  donated fish/bugs available *in-game per season* (based on `months[]` data), not the
  timestamps of when items were donated. Previously everything showed as Spring because
  all donations were recorded in April.
- **Edit Town modal visual polish** — modal now renders via React portal to `document.body`,
  escaping the `overflow-hidden` header stacking context that caused visual clipping.
- **Missing `@vercel/analytics` dependency** — package was referenced in `App.tsx` but not
  installed; added to dependencies so the build no longer fails.
- **Type safety** — `isFish()`, `isFossil()`, `isArtPiece()` type guards in `utils.ts`; `itemNotes()` no longer does an unsafe `as FishType` cast
